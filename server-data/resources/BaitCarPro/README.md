# BaitCarPro

A fully-featured, networked BaitCar system. Any vehicle can be tagged as a BaitCar with an intuitive menu. BaitCars can be remotely disabled by the player that installed the BaitCar system regardless of who is driving the vehicle. Players are unable to enter/exit a disabled BaitCar, and players inside the vehicle will be given a fake wanted level and an alert.
   
## Config

Settings can be modified in `bcpcl.lua`. Not all settings are listed here.

|setting|default|description|
| --- | --- | --- |
|`useAcePerm`|`false`|Toggles whether Ace permissions are required to open the menu.|
|`menuControl`|`246`|Sets which control activates the menu. Default is the 'Y' key.|
|`showGPS`|`true`|Toggles whether BaitCar blip is shown on the minimap. Only affects player that installed BaitCar system currently.|
|`alertOnEntry`|`true`|Displays text reading "BaitCar Occupied" at the bottom of the screen when a suspect has entered the BaitCar.|
|`toggleMouse`|`false`|Toggles whether menu can be controlled with the mouse.|
|`blipColor`|`1`|Changes color of radar blip for BaitCar. Default is red.|
|`blipRoute`|`true`|Toggles route to blip on minimap, only seems to display while in a vehicle.|
|`blipHeading`|`true`|Toggles whether blip shows an indicator for the direction BaitCar is facing.|
|`blipSprite`|`426`|Sets blip sprite on minimap, default is the blip for Insurgents.|

Notification text can also be changed in the config, in case you don't like my wording or wish to translate. Translating the menu will have to be done manually.

## Usage

Open the menu with the control button set in the config. Installing the BaitCar system in a vehicle will allow you to remotely disable, unlock, and rearm the BaitCar. Clicking the `Video Feed` option will display video from a dash cam viewing the interior of the vehicle. If the script breaks due to someone deleting a disabled BaitCar, use the `Reset` option to reset *ALL* BaitCar instances in the server.

## Dependencies
This script uses NativeUI for the menu, thus the [Lua version of NativeUI from FrazzIe](https://github.com/FrazzIe/NativeUILua) is required.

## Installation
Clone this repository in your `resources` folder.
Add `start BaitCarPro` to your `server.cfg`.
If using Ace Permissions add the following lines to your `server.cfg`:

`add_ace group.canBait BaitCarPro.open_menu allow`  
`add_principal identifier.steam:STEAM64HEXGOESHERE group.canBait`

Make sure to change the placeholder identifier.
